Template project

This folder mirrors the project with the Adobe Premiere Pro Project Template.

Here's anything that's nonstandard about the template project.
* Project item and label color is turned on
* Mercury Playback Engine (Project settings) is set to Open CL

By using this folder template, it's easier to start projects - and extra easy to move/cleanup a project as everything is self contained.

Of course, your mileage may vary and this project and assets are merely a demonstration of the possibilities of templates.
